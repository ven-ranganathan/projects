# Hello ðŸ¤–

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Hi, I'm Venkat and I'm an Electrical Engineering major at Binghamton University graduating in May, 2024. I enjoy hiking, camping, and going on road trips with my dog.

### My VSCode setup:
~09/04/2022

This isn't super-important, so I set it off to the side

I wanted to share that I figured out how to setup my debug environment for C using GDB. I'm stoked I can step through my code _and be able to see the values of my variables as the code is being executed, be able to see what's changing in the register, AND see what stacks are being called_
