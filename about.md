# Hello ðŸ¤–
## Hi, I'm Venkat and I'm an electrical engineering major at Binghamton University graduating in May, 2024. I enjoy hiking, camping, and going on road trips with my dog.

## My VSCode setup:

Is this important? Probably, not. 

I'm proud that I figured out how to setup my debug environment for C/C+. I'm stoked I can step through my code and _be able to see the values of my variables as the code is being executed AND be able to see what's changing in the register_
