# Hello ðŸ¤–

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Hi, I'm Venkat and I'm an Electrical Engineering major at Binghamton University graduating in May, 2024. I enjoy hiking, camping, and going on road trips with my dog.

### My VSCode setup:
~09/04/2022

This isn't super-important, so I set it off to the side

I figured out how to setup my debug environment for C using GDB. I'm stoked I can step through my code _and be able to see the values of my variables as the code is being executed, see what's changing in the register, AND see what stacks are being called_. Prior to setting up my debug environment, I was using a standard compile & run combination using a gcc compiler. My current setup is _much_ nicer ðŸ™‚
