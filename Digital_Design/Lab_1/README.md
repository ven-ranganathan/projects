#Lab_1

This lab demonstartes programming the Artix7 in Verilog to take an 8-bit input, 
load the value into the register, then plug in the value from the register as 'P' to solve the specific equation 
P^2 - 2P and output the solution as binary LEDs

In the image below, Switches [2:0] are active, representing the binary values 00000111 (or 7 in decimal)

7 is plugged in as 'P' into the equation P^2 - 2P, 7^2 - 2x7 which equals 35, which is 00100011 in binary
