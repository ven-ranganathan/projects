#PROJECT_2 notes

- Reflectance sensors and LCD output is working as expected, all sensors work properly on replacement 3pi
(Need to return working 3pi to Prof. Jain after Project_2 presentation)

3-way intersection:

Right and left 3-way intersection is not working effectively
    Needs to pause at every intersection and choose to go forward or turn

4-way intersection:

Needs to pause at 4-way intersection and randomly choose forward/right/left

Currently biased towards the right corner of the board

Navigation is starting to look good

Needs to make more turns at 3 and 4-way intersections

Every intersection is left turn biased

Goals for completing solo project_2:

1. Convert decimal sensor values to combined decimal sum, then convert to hex to be able to easily consolidate similar movements

2. Create individual functions for moving forward, handling right and left turns, handling corners, and handling intersections
    - Combine 3 and 4-way intersections into one intersection function?

3. Create mine detection function
    - Only activate when moving forward?
    - Add small celebration when mine found
    - Wait until mine removed before continuining or have it reverse and continue movement on its own?

4. Create piezo (sound) function
    - Add sound when mine detected
    - Add celebration function

5. Draw out likely cases to be encountered on 36x48 grid?
    - Draw out likely cases where mines are detected?
