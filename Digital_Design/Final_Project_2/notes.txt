#PROJECT_2 notes

- Reflectance sensors and LCD output is working as expected, all sensors work properly on replacement 3pi
(Need to return working 3pi to Prof. Jain after Project_2 presentation)

3-way intersection:

Right and left 3-way intersection is not working effectively
    Needs to pause at every intersection and choose to go forward or turn

4-way intersection:

Needs to pause at 4-way intersection and randomly choose forward/right/left

Currently biased towards the right corner of the board

Navigation is starting to look good

Needs to make more turns at 3 and 4-way intersections
