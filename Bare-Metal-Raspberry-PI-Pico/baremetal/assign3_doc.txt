Create the watchdog and systic drivers.  (From this assignment forward, unless otherwise specified, your programs should use these drivers.)  Set up your main loop to run with a period of 1ms and a watchdog timeout of 1.5ms.  

Create an FSM to flash the LED at 0.5 Hz.  In your main loop, add a blocking loop similar to the following to test the watchdog:

while( pb_is_pressed() );

The led should flash once every 2 seconds.  When you hold the button down, you should notice the processor resetting continuously (you may see the LED flash, flicker, or remain on or off depending on your program configuration.

Make sure to rename your source files by adding a .txt (as in previous assignments).  Submit assign3.c.txt and your watchdog and systick drivers (.c.txt and .h.txt) as well as a video demonstrating that the watchdog is triggering.
