### SUBMISSION

I have done this assignment completely on my own. I have not copied it, nor have I given my solution to anyone else. I understand that if I am involved in plagiarism or cheating I will have to sign an official form that I have cheated and that this form will be stored in my official university record. I also understand that I will receive a grade of "0" for the involved assignment and my grade will be reduced by one level (e.g., from "A" to "A-" or from "B+" to "B") for my first offense, and that I will receive a grade of "F" for the course for any additional offense of any kind.

By submitting this lab project, I confirm the above statement is true and that I have followed the course guidelines and policies.
