## Lab-4: Prime Numbers

*Replace anything surrounded by the `< >` symbols.*

### SUMMARY

< There are two functions:

1) unsigned int isPrime(unsigned int number): 
this checks whether a integer "number" is prime or not; returns '0' if not prime and '1' if prime

2) unsigned int maxPrimeFactor(unsigned int number):
returns '0' if "number" is < 2; returns "number" if "number" itself is a prime;
returns the largest prime factor of "number" otherwise >
