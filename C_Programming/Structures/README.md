## Lab-7: Working with Structures

*Replace anything surrounded by the `< >` symbols.*

### SUMMARY

< In Lab-7, we will implement a program that calculates:
●	The number of elapsed days between two dates.
●	On which day of the week a particular date falls. >

### NOTES, KNOWN BUGS, AND/OR INCOMPLETE PARTS

< Everything works, but I struggled with the last funcrtion for a while because it wouldn't work if I set 
daystr = "Sunday" (or whatever corresponding day), it would only work if i used strcpy(daystr, "Sunday"); 

After fixing that, I had no issues. Valgrind checked out okay as well>

### REFERENCES

< Just my notesa and the class tips, which I included in the comments in my code >
